# Poly Micro Manager - Logging System Documentation

## Overview

The Poly Micro Manager implements a structured logging system that captures and stores log entries from various microservices within a project. Each log entry is stored in MongoDB and contains standardized fields to facilitate filtering, searching, and analysis.

## Log Structure

Each log entry contains the following fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| id | string | Auto-generated | Unique identifier for the log entry |
| project_id | string | Yes | ID of the project the log belongs to |
| service_id | string | Yes | ID or name of the service that generated the log |
| severity | enum | Yes | Log severity level (info, warn, error, debug) |
| message | string | Yes | The actual log message |
| timestamp | string | Auto-generated if not provided | When the log was created (ISO format) |
| test_id | string | No | ID of the test if the log was generated during testing |
| func_id | string | No | ID of the function that generated the log |
| source | string | No | Source of the log (e.g., module name, component) |

## Backend Components

### 1. Log Model (`app/models/log.py`)

The `LogEntry` class represents a log entry in the application and provides:
- Getters and setters for all log fields
- Validation for required fields (project_id, service_id, message, severity)
- Methods to convert between dictionary and object formats
- Timestamp auto-generation

```python
class LogEntry:
    def __init__(
        self,
        project_id: str,
        service_id: str,
        message: str,
        severity: str = "info",  # Lowercase severity values
        test_id: Optional[str] = None,
        func_id: Optional[str] = None,
        timestamp: Optional[str] = None,
        source: Optional[str] = None,
        id: Optional[str] = None
    ):
        # Implementation...
```

### 2. Log Schema (`app/schemas/log.py`)

Defines Pydantic schemas for validation:

```python
class Severity(StrEnum):
    """Log severity enum"""
    DEBUG = "debug"
    INFO = "info"
    WARN = "warn"
    ERROR = "error"

class LogBase(BaseModel):
    """Base log schema"""
    project_id: str
    service_id: str
    message: str
    severity: Severity = Severity.INFO
    test_id: Optional[str] = None
    func_id: Optional[str] = None
    source: Optional[str] = None
    timestamp: Optional[str] = None
```

### 3. Log Repository (`app/db/repositories/log_repository.py`)

Handles database operations for log entries:

- `create_log()` - Inserts a new log with auto-generated ID and timestamp
- `get_all_logs()` - Retrieves logs with optional filtering
- `get_logs_by_project()` - Gets logs for a specific project
- `get_logs_by_service()` - Gets logs for a specific service
- `update_log()` - Updates an existing log
- `delete_log()` - Removes a log entry

### 4. Log Service (`app/services/log_service.py`)

Business logic layer that:
- Validates log data
- Coordinates with the repository
- Handles error conditions
- Translates between API and database formats

## API Endpoints

The following endpoints are available for log management:

- `GET /api/logs/` - Get all logs with optional filtering
- `GET /api/logs/{log_id}` - Get a specific log by ID
- `GET /api/logs/project/{project_id}` - Get logs for a specific project
- `POST /api/logs/` - Create a new log entry
- `POST /api/logs/raw` - Create a log from raw dictionary data
- `PUT /api/logs/{log_id}` - Update an existing log
- `DELETE /api/logs/{log_id}` - Delete a log entry
- `POST /api/logs/analyze` - Analyze logs using AI for a specific project

## Creating Logs

### Using the API

```python
# Using the structured API endpoint
log_data = {
    "project_id": "project-123",
    "service_id": "auth-service",
    "message": "User authentication successful",
    "severity": "info",
    "source": "authentication-module",
    "test_id": "auth-test-1",
    "func_id": "login-func"
}

response = requests.post("http://api-url/api/logs/", json=log_data)
```

### Using the Model in Code

```python
from app.models.log import LogEntry
from app.schemas.log import Severity

# Create a log entry using the model
log_entry = LogEntry(
    project_id="project-123",
    service_id="auth-service",
    message="Database connection error",
    severity="error",
    source="database-module"
)

# Save to database via repository
log_repository = LogRepository(database)
created_log = await log_repository.create_log(log_entry)
```

## Frontend Integration

The frontend uses TanStack Query (formerly React Query) via dedicated hooks to fetch and display logs efficiently:

```typescript
// Get logs for a specific project
const { data: logs, isLoading, error, refetch } = useLogsByProject(projectId);

// Get logs for a specific service
const { data: serviceLogs } = useLogsByService(serviceId);

// Custom hook for filtering logs
const { filteredLogs, setFilters } = useFilteredLogs(logs, {
  severity: ['error', 'warn'],
  timeRange: { start, end }
});
```

TanStack Query provides several benefits for log management:
- Automatic caching of log data
- Background refetching to keep logs up-to-date
- Loading and error states management
- Optimistic updates when adding new logs

The logs are displayed using the `LogViewer` component which:
- Shows logs in a tabular format
- Allows filtering by service and severity
- Displays color-coded severity levels
- Supports pagination
- Features real-time log updates
- Includes AI-powered log analysis capabilities

## Best Practices

1. **Always include required fields**: project_id, service_id, message, and severity
2. **Use consistent severity levels**: stick to debug, info, warn, error
3. **Include source information**: helps with debugging and tracing
4. **Use test_id and func_id when appropriate**: helps correlate logs with test runs
5. **Keep messages concise but informative**: include relevant context in the message

## Severity Level Guidelines

- **debug**: Detailed information, typically useful only for diagnosing problems
- **info**: Confirmation that things are working as expected
- **warn**: Indication that something unexpected happened, but the application still works
- **error**: A failure that should be investigated

## Example Log Patterns

### Authentication Event
```json
{
  "project_id": "project-123",
  "service_id": "auth-service",
  "message": "User login successful: user_id=456",
  "severity": "info",
  "source": "authentication-module"
}
```

### Error Condition
```json
{
  "project_id": "project-123",
  "service_id": "payment-service",
  "message": "Payment processing failed: Invalid card details",
  "severity": "error",
  "source": "payment-gateway",
  "func_id": "process-payment"
}
```

### Test Result
```json
{
  "project_id": "project-123",
  "service_id": "user-service",
  "message": "User creation test passed",
  "severity": "info",
  "test_id": "user-test-3",
  "func_id": "create-user"
}
```

## AI-Powered Log Analysis

The system now includes an AI-powered log analysis feature that uses Gemini 1.5 to provide intelligent insights about logs.

### Backend Implementation

The AI log analysis feature is implemented in the backend with the following components:

1. **Analysis Endpoint**: `POST /api/logs/analyze` accepts a project ID and returns AI-generated insights about the logs.

2. **Schema Models**:
   - `LogAnalysisRequest`: Contains the project_id for analysis
   - `LogAnalysisResponse`: Contains the analysis results, log count, and status

3. **AI Integration**: The system uses Google's Gemini 1.5 model to analyze patterns in logs, identify issues, and provide actionable insights.

### Example Usage

```python
# Request
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/logs/analyze",
    json={"project_id": "project-123"}
)

# Response
{
    "project_id": "project-123",
    "analysis": "Analysis shows 3 critical errors in the payment service...",
    "log_count": 142,
    "success": true
}
```

### Frontend Integration

The `LogViewer` component includes an "Analyze Logs" button that triggers the AI analysis. Results are displayed in a modal dialog showing:

- Summary of analyzed logs
- Critical errors and patterns identified
- Potential issues requiring attention
- Overall system health assessment

### Configuration

To use the AI analysis feature, you must set up a Gemini API key in your `.env` file:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing required fields**: Ensure all required fields are present
2. **Invalid severity value**: Use only debug, info, warn, or error
3. **Timestamp format issues**: Use ISO format or let the system generate it
4. **AI analysis not working**: Verify your Gemini API key is correctly set in the .env file

### Debugging Tips

1. Check the MongoDB logs collection directly if entries aren't appearing
2. Verify project_id and service_id values match existing entries
3. For bulk imports, use the /logs/raw endpoint
