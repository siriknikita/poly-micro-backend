# Poly Micro Manager - Backend Architecture Documentation

## Architecture Overview

The Poly Micro Manager backend implements a **Layered Microservices Architecture** with a clear separation of concerns. This architecture follows modern best practices for building scalable, maintainable, and testable backend systems.

### Architectural Layers

1. **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests/responses and routing
2. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and orchestrates operations
3. **Repository Layer**: Manages data access and persistence
4. **Schema Layer**: Defines data structures and validation
5. **Core Layer**: Houses configuration and shared utilities

### Key Architectural Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Dependency Injection**: Services and repositories are injected where needed
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access operations
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module handles one aspect of functionality
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Components can be extended without modification

## Component Descriptions

### API Layer

The API layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. It's organized around domain resources (projects, services, logs, metrics) with each having its own router. This allows for a clean separation of API endpoints.

#### Key Features:
- RESTful API design
- Route grouping by domain
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Clear dependency injection

### Service Layer

The service layer contains the business logic and orchestrates operations between multiple repositories. It's responsible for validating input, coordinating data access, and implementing the application's business rules.

#### Key Features:
- Independent of web frameworks
- Reusable business logic
- Focused on domain operations
- Proper exception handling

### Repository Layer

The repository layer abstracts data access operations, making it easier to switch database implementations or add caching. Each repository is responsible for a specific domain entity.

#### Key Features:
- MongoDB integration
- Generic CRUD operations
- Domain-specific query methods
- Transaction support

### Schema Layer

The schema layer defines data structures using Pydantic models. It handles validation, serialization, and deserialization.

#### Key Features:
- Input validation
- Response serialization
- Clear data models
- Separation between input and output models

### Core Layer

The core layer contains configuration, utilities, and other shared components used throughout the application.

#### Key Features:
- Configuration management
- Environment variable handling
- Sample data generation
- Utility functions

## Database Schema

The application uses MongoDB as its database, with the following collections:

- **projects**: Stores project information
- **services**: Stores service information linked to projects
- **logs**: Stores log entries
- **cpu_data**: Stores CPU metrics data

## Authentication & Security (Future Implementation)

This architecture is designed to easily accommodate authentication and authorization:

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- API rate limiting
- Input validation

## Deployment

The architecture supports multiple deployment strategies:

- Traditional deployment on servers
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Serverless deployment

## Architectural Considerations and Recommendations

### Strengths

1. **Modular Design**: The clear separation of concerns makes the codebase highly maintainable and allows for independent development of components.

2. **Scalability**: The stateless nature of the services and the use of asynchronous I/O with FastAPI enables horizontal scaling.

3. **Testability**: The dependency injection pattern and clear boundaries between layers make unit testing straightforward.

4. **API Design**: RESTful API design with proper resource modeling ensures a clean and intuitive API surface.

5. **Database Abstraction**: The repository pattern abstracts database operations, making it easier to switch databases or add caching.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Authentication & Authorization**: Implementing a robust auth system would enhance security.

2. **API Versioning**: Adding versioning to the API would ensure backward compatibility.

3. **Caching**: Implementing a caching layer could improve performance for frequently accessed data.

4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: For true microservices, consider implementing event-driven patterns for inter-service communication.

5. **Containerization**: Dockerizing the application would improve deployability and consistency across environments.

### Future Evolution

The current architecture provides a solid foundation for future evolution:

1. **Breaking into True Microservices**: Each domain (projects, services, logs, metrics) could become a separate microservice with its own database.

2. **API Gateway**: Adding an API gateway would provide a single entry point for clients and enable additional features like rate limiting.

3. **Message Queues**: Implementing message queues would enable asynchronous processing and better fault tolerance.

4. **Service Discovery**: Adding service discovery would make the system more resilient and easier to scale.

5. **Observability**: Enhancing logging, metrics, and tracing would improve monitoring and debugging capabilities.

## Conclusion

The Poly Micro Manager backend follows a well-designed layered architecture that emphasizes modularity, maintainability, and scalability. While it's not a full microservices architecture in its current form, it provides a solid foundation for evolving towards one as the application's needs grow.

The clear separation of concerns, RESTful API design, and abstraction of data access make the codebase easy to understand, modify, and extend. With the recommended improvements, it can evolve into a robust, scalable, and secure system capable of handling complex microservices management requirements.
